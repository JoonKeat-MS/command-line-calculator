## Features (v1.1)
- Supports basic arithmetic: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Supports parentheses `()`
- Supports power: `**`
- Includes math functions: `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`, `log()`, `log10()`
- Includes constants: `pi`, `e`
- Error handling for invalid input

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

2. Run the calculator:
   ```bash
   python calculator.py
   ```
   

3. Example:
    ```text
    >>> sin(pi/2)
    sin(pi/2) = 1.0

    >>> log(e)
    log(e) = 1.0
    ```
